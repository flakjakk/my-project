### Benoni

Start of school - Tom Newby - Meh!

Dad in action...

![Dad teaching the Benoni Corps band!](assets/images/ejk-newsp-24apr70-band-training-b.jpg)  

Deidre and I started playing music at the tender age of 6, my instrument 'of choice' was the cornet, Deidre's the tenor horn. We played in the Benoni Corps Youth Band - for the uninitiated, 'Corps' are what Salvation Army churches are called. My dad was the Bandmaster and taught us how to read and play. We practically were the Band!  

### Geoff

First memory getting stung by centipede thing in Benoni driveway  
Dad smoking  

Running through window with cowboy hat over face - first miracle as didn't get  a scratch  

> Ed: One day while dad was mowing the lawn the mower-blade connected with a bolt hidden in the grass and sent it flying through one of the bedroom windows. It was a miracle no-one was hurt. Some days later Geoff was running in the yard with his cowboy hat over his face (as one does!)  and he ran slap-bang into the same window, shattering it. I don't know how he wasn't cut by the glass. Another miracle!  

Biltong hanging in garage  
Cheryl being small  - eating sand. And singing a lot!

> Dad driving over a scooter and thinking it was one of us kids  
> Learning to ride a bicycle and falling into the cactus  
> Having to catch the bus home, losing the 5c bus-fare and walking all the way home  
> Dad making us wooden houses painted white with red roofs

Shooting out the light bulb with my camera water pistol  
> Ed: I remember this well. We shot one light out by accident, then decided to try another (which worked spectacularly) so we destroyed some more, but not all of them ('cos that would have been wasteful!)

Judo  

At Jo'burg One [slang for the Corps based at Salvation Army Headquarters] we joined the Youth Band. This was the big time. These guys actually played stuff in keys other than C, F or G. Hectic. Learned how to read faster, and lip-tune some - you have to when you're playing the wrong fingering and your notes need some bending to fit the key. It must have sounded terrible!

We moved back to Johannesburg in April and I joined the Roosevelt High School Cadet Band on trumpet. Got my half-colours for Band and in 1980, when Mr. Blackstock asked Pier Pucci - who was the band Drum Major if he would form a group to back singers for the school concert Pier asked if I would play guitar and so I joined him and his brother Rob, a drummer, to form the school band.

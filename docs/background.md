# Background  

This is primarily a collection of familial memories. We traveled all over the country, lived in all the provinces (except for the Free State), and got to experience much that was not granted to other children our age.  

Our parents were very special, and are sorely missed. We watched as they went about ministering to the needs of others in so many different ways, in so many different places.

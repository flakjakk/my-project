# Prospect and Mpame


## Mpame

**Games**  

Once the table had been cleared after supper the adults would sit out on the verandah while us kids played board- or card-games. Monopoly and Cluedo were favourites. Card games we usually played were Rummy, Canasta, Bridge or Klaberjass. We also had a game called Pit where you buy and sell produce (wheat, rye, barley etc.). I don't remember much about the game except that it involved a lot of shouting!

We played a lot more games than this, I just don't recall them!

### Places

Clark's Point  
The Sphinx  
Porpoise Gully  

**Flat Rocks**  

I remember fishing with Geoff at Flat Rocks the one time. The tide was coming in so we had to be careful - at high tide the rocks are completely covered, and the sea at the Wild Coast is, well, _wild_!  

We'd made our last-ditch casts and were thinking of packing up as we were already dodging waves when a fish took Geoff's line with a vengeance. I reeled in and scrambled to get our gear together while Geoff tried to bring the fish in and the incoming tide helped to get it up onto the Flats. Because the waves were knee-deep we couldn't see what it was until he pulled it in close: the biggest Moonie I've ever seen! We just managed to make it back to the rocks before the tide came surging in _hard_, covering the Flats completely.  

**Shelly Beach**  

I found a strange fish one day at low tide at Shelly Beach. It was transparent with a luminous blue colour, about 35cm long and 1-2cm in the vertical. Always wondered what it was...

**Golfing**  

Tried playing golf at the camp a few times. You tee off from the bank in front of the camp and attempt to get your ball over the stream and well onto the bank on the other side. You have two options: rough (really rough) or bunker. The only green is the colour of the grass!  

Collecting driftwood for the bonfire  
Mpame with my bike  
Gary’s old Volvo  
Stringing up cables to some of the huts with Les Westwood. Plugging in and firing up the generator for the first time [1981, I think]

Uncle Clive shooting the green mamba in the end hut

**Knees up!**  

The holiday when I damaged my knee trying to beat a wave around the rocks and had to be taken to Umtata hospital. They drained the blood into a kidney bowl using a **massive** syringe. I had to use a crutch to get around and was required to keep my foot elevated for two weeks of the holiday - which was torture - but if I remember correctly we were there for nearly 4 weeks that year so it wasn't so bad

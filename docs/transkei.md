The holiday when I damaged my knee trying to beat a wave around the rocks and had to be taken to Umtata hospital. They drained the blood into a kidney bowl using a **massive** syringe. I had to use a crutch to get around and was required to keep my foot elevated for two weeks of the holiday - which was torture - but if I remember correctly we were there for nearly 4 weeks that year so it wasn't so bad

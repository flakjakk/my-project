# East London


## 13 Porter Street (House 1)

Watching films at the library on Thursday nights [Friday?]

Jamming as a band on donated instruments then getting upset because dad sold them (but we needed the money!)  
Spooky the cat disappeared one day - but we saw her again later in the year!  


## Moore Street (House 2)

Enjoying a tour of an SA Navy frigate. Impressive!  


## The Maris Stella Convent (House 3)  

We moved here when dad was the pastor at the Quigney Baptist Church  

Going down to the theatre at Orient Beach on Sunday nights to watch the orchestra  
The ship wreck on the beach-front in front of the Kennaway Hotel  

**Chips at the Kennaway**  
Often, on a Sunday night after the service at Quigney Baptist we would walk down to the beachfront to purchase a pack of chips. We would share these while watching the sea pound the wreck that had run aground in front of the Kennaway Hotel. It was on one of these walks that Spooky the cat, who disappeared when we lived at 13 Porter Street found us again [we were living at the Maris Stella by this time]  

Meeting Dr. Chris Barnard  
Puppet shows  

**Sewage problems**  
This bears some explanation:

Go-carts  

**Model-building**  
Picked up the hobby of model building while in East London. We built both planes and warships and you could purchase an aeroplane model for 69c from the one particular shop, so we saved our money assiduously for this purpose. My first one was a Spitfire, and I was so proud of it!  

Reading war comics (lots of)  

### Selborne Primary

Piano lessons that turned me off learning  
‚ÄòPlip, plop‚Äô  


**The Tuck Shop**

My favourite was the sausage roll. This came in two sizes, a 6c and an 11c version. Smothered in tomato sauce! Yummy...  
Small sausage roll for 6c and big one for 11c with sauce üëç.  


**The School Orchestra**

I played trumpet in the school orchestra which was led by Mr. Ian Sampson. On band days I had to lug my trumpet with me on the bus to school and back. One day I left it on the bus when I got off near home and never twigged until I got on the bus the next day and the bus driver gave it back to me. Whew!  

Mr. Sampson thought I might go further so set up an audition for me with the East London Youth Orchestra, but we were leaving for Johannesburg so I never got to try out

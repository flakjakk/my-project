**Mowing the 'lawn'**  

Geoff and I were tasked to mow the lawn in front of the house - more like a field than a lawn. It extended past the end of the property along the road towards the Farmers Hall. All we had was a push-mower effort and the grass was _long_, some of it up to about 50cm high (you have to try this sometime). We realised it was going to be a long morning and because we could only operate the machine one at a time we decided to take turns. We divided the grassed area up into sections, I took the first stint then handed over to Geoff while I sat on the fence watching. Geoff set to with a will and as he got going mom drove past on her way to the shop. We waved, she waved and was gone.

I took over, mowed my section then handed over to Geoff again. He was well into his second stint when mom drove past again, coming back from the shops. We waved, she waved and was gone.

I took over then handed over to Geoff who went into the last stretch. Mom drove past again, this time looking very concerned because every time she saw us Geoff was the one mowing while I relaxed on the fence. She must have thought I was being very, very lazy, or something, but what do you do? Timing is everything!

**The library**  
I discovered the school library early on and spent many lunch-breaks there [after munching a large lunch, packed by mom]. It was here that I first came across The Lord of the Rings and I booked it out and read it right through, an exercise I repeated every year for at least the next 8 years

Deidre and I climbed the tower attached to the factory a number of times. The ladder only had space for one person at a time, and it was rather high, and somewhat dangerous, but the view from the top was quite spectacular.

**Guavas**  
We used to pick guavas off the trees in the orchard - they were freely available and much appreciated!  

**The bogey**  
I found a bogey in the factory. It came from one of the cane trolleys, and I decided to take it back to Chiltley to use as a barbell. I figured it would be an easy task to roll it all the way home on the railroad track which ran from the factory in Paddock all the way past Chiltley at a gentle incline. I placed it on the rails at the road crossing and started pushing it. I had to keep stopping it from running ahead because of the incline, but this became tedious after a while, so I thought I might run ahead of it and catch it further down the track. Things didn't work out so well, though.  

I ran ahead of it about 100m or so and waited for it to catch up, expecting it to trundle along at a reasonable pace but I didn't reckon on the effect gravity would have on a free-wheeling bogey on rails! I watched it's approach but soon realised that it was belting along at a rapid rate.

**Camping in Oribi Gorge with Peter Holmes**  
Peter picked us up at the C residence in his short-wheelbase Landrover and drove us to the Gorge. We trekked into the Gorge and eventually found a cliff with a massive overhang which we decided to use as our camp. We built a fire as darkness was falling then picked out places to bed down and sat around cooking something to munch, then we chatted away until we fell asleep.

**The library**  
I discovered the school library early on and spent many lunch-breaks there [after munching a large lunch, packed by mom]. It was here that I first came across The Lord of the Ring and I booked it out and read it right through, an exercise I repeated every year for at least the next 8 years.

**Guavas**  
We used to pick guavas off the trees in the orchard - they were freely available and much appreciated! 

**The bogey**  
I found a bogey in the factory. It came from one of the cane trolleys, and I decided to take it back to Chiltley to use as a barbell. I figured it would be an easy task to roll it all the way home on the railroad track which ran from the factory in Paddock all the way past Chiltley at a gentle incline. I placed it on the rails at the road crossing and started pushing it. I had to keep stopping it from running ahead because of the incline, but this became tedious after a while, so I thought I might run ahead of it and catch it further down the track. 

**Camping in Oribi Gorge with Peter Holmes**  
Peter picked us up at the C residence in his short-wheelbase Landrover and drove us to the Gorge. We trekked into the Gorge and eventually found a cliff with a massive overhang which we decided to use as our camp. We built a fire as darkness was falling then picked out places to bed down and sat around cooking something to munch, then we chatted away until we fell asleep.

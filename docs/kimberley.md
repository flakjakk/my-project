# Kimberley

We arrived in Kimberley in mid 1972 [June - July??]. The folks were transferred there as their first commission after graduating from the Salvation Army Training College and were tasked to pastor the Kimberley Corps and manage the attached Men's Home. We lived in the 'manse' at 13 Crossman Road - Deidre and I were in Standard 1 [Grade 3].

I started piano lessons at the Theatre in Kimberly. Had a nice teacher and learned a lot. I got as far as my Grade 1 practical exam but didn't hack it [the examiner was a really old guy who intimidated me muchly] so I kind of lost interest for a while after that.

There were war memorials with statues and cannons all over town  
Tony Blockâ€™s birthday party  
Travelling to Bloem [whatever for?]  
Visiting the Magersfontein Battlefield with dad  

**The library**  
Whenever I could I would go up to the local library and read until it closed. I never took books out, just read them there, placing them back in the correct place afterwards  

As far as I can ascertain, this is where the library used to be: <https://goo.gl/maps/76FZEZCAGJe2LpYc7>

**Kimberley Corps**

Saturday night Open Air Meeting  

The Corps was more established than Benoni Corps and had a bigger band, but it was still pretty small. We had fun most of the time, especially during Christmas season when we went 'carolling'

**"Crispy, crackly notes"**  

Geoff and myself were both laid up in bed with chicken pox or measles or something and we started recording a radio show on the tape deck where contestants won money prizes. The host would offer them 'crrrispy, crrrackly notes'!

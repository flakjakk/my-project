# Kimberley

We arrived in Kimberley in mid 1972 [June - July??]. It was mom and dad's first appointment as Lieutenants straight out of Training College and they were tasked to pastor the Kimberley Corps and manage the attached Men's Home. We lived in the 'manse' at 13 Crossman Road  


## Things to remember

Tar-melting heat, freezing cold in winter  
Kimberley Preparatory School  
Kimberly Boys Junior School - Ed  
The Big Hole  
The funfair  
There were war memorials with statues and cannons all over town

**The library**  
Whenever I could I would go up to the local library and read until it closed. I never took books out, just read them there, placing them back in the correct place afterwards

**"Crispy, crackly notes"**  

Geoff and myself were both laid up in bed with chicken pox or measles or something and we started recording a radio show on the tape deck where contestants won money prizes. The host would offer them 'crrrispy, crrrackly notes'!
